# A noval framework for considering Visual Dialog

Within this framwwork, the VisDial agent can generate more accurate answers in consecutive dialog rounds. All the generated examples as follows.

# Comparison of generated examples on Visual Dialog v1.0 val split (2064 dialogs) 

Please see all_generated_dialogs_2064_visdialv10val.txt.

# Image-based Visual Dialog
Visual Dialog needs an AI agent to chat with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given a specific image, a dialog history, and a follow-up question about the image, the task for the AI agent is to answer the question in free-form natural language.
