# A nonval framework for Visual Dialog(VisDial)

Retrieve-based metrices on VisDial, i.e., NDCG, MRR, Mean, R@{1,5,10}, are not a good performance indicator to generate acurate, high-quality response for Visual Dialog agent. However, we found that high NDCG and response quality are in the opposite direction.

# Visual Dialog (VisDial) task
Visual Dialog needs an AI agent to chat with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given a specific image, a dialog history, and a follow-up question about the image, the task for the AI agent is to answer the question in free-form natural language.
