# A novel framework for Visual Dialog(VisDial)

Retrieve-based metrics on VisDial, i.e., NDCG, MRR, Mean, R@{1,5,10}, is not a good performance indicator to generate accurate, high-quality responses for Visual Dialog agent. However, we found that high NDCG and generated response quality are in the opposite direction.

# Visual Dialog (VisDial) task
Visual Dialog needs an AI agent to chat with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a follow-up question about the image, VisDial agent aims to answer the question in free-form natural language.
