# Visual Dialog (VisDial)
Visual Dialog requires an AI agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a follow-up question about the image, the task is to answer the question. [ref: https://visualdialog.org/]


# About me

虚步, a Ph.D. student at BUPT. I am very fortunate to be advised by my advisor. My research is in the area of Vision, Language, and Reasoning, with a focus on Visual Dialogue. I am particularly interested in building a visually-grounded conversational AI (social robot) that can see the world and talk with us in natural language. Other interests include Visual/Language Grounding, Visual Reasoning, Visual Question Generation, and Visually-grounded Referring Expression.<br>

Now I've been working on the GuessWhich, Visual Dialog(VisDial) and Talking-to-Videos(Video-Grounded Dialogue) task, please feel free to contact me with pangweitf@bupt.edu.cn or pangweitf@163.com if you have any questions or concerns.<br>
